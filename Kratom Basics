  <h2> Kratom Basics</h2>
    
    <p>Kratom is a large leaf from the Indonesian tree called Mitragyna Speciosa,
    which is more commonly referred to as Biak-Biak by native Indonesians (or simply the Kratom Tree).
    Spectrum Kratom imports this leaf in a crushed leaf or powder form directly from the indigenous farmers,
    where samples are then sent out to a third-party laboratory to verify potency, cleanliness, 
    and a litany of other characteristics with consumer safety in mind. After our leaf or powder passes these rigorous lab tests,
    it’s then encapsulated and packaged here at our facility. It is important to note that even though Kratom is an unregulated product, 
    we impose these self-regulations in accordance with cGMP standards to keep our consumers safe and to offer peace of mind.

  <h2>GMP</h2>
    
    <p> Spectrum Kratom is excited to announce its GMP certification verified through the American Kratom Association’s GMP 
    program official auditors. GMP simply means “Good Manufacturing Practices” and includes such facets as lab testing all of 
    our products being sold, manufacturing them within a clean/sterile environment, implementing traceability, 
    lot numbers and batch records, along with annual 3rd party facility audits. Learn More

  <h2>Alkaloids</h2>
  
    <p>Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are Kratom’s most abundant & active alkaloids. Although little research has been 
      completed as to these alkaloid’s long-term effects, Spectrum Kratom uses an accredited third party laboratory to test for
      both of Kratom’s alkaloid percentages (which we print on your package for reference).

      In addition, Spectrum Kratom tests for a multitude of other assays such as: E Coli, bacteria levels, Salmonella,
      heavy metals content and more. We promise that as more research is completed & documented on this miraculous plant 
      that our standards will adjust accordingly.

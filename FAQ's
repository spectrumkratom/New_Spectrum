  <h3> What is kratom and where does it come from </h3>
    <p>Kratom, also known as Mitragyna Speciosa, refers to the leaves of a South East Asian tree that are closely related to the 
      Coffee & Tea family. The Kratom tree is found in a number of countries within Southeast Asia, specifically Thailand, Malaysia, 
      and Indonesia where it thrives in wet, humus-rich areas and mineral abundant soil. This tree grows leaves that according to 
      research are abundantly rich in therapeutic and soothing properties, therefore considered to be one of the most sacred herbs in the world.
      In Southeast Asia, Kratom powder and leaves have been used in ceremonies, rituals and folk medicine for centuries and only in recent years have made it’s way to the western world. The tree normally grows to a height ranging between
      12 to 30 feet tall and approximately 15 feet wide, though some species have been reported to exceed 70 feet in height.

  <h3>What are some of the different types/strains of Kratom and the most commonly purchased forms?</h3>
    <p>Some of the most common strains of Kratom sold throughout the United States are Maeng Da, Bali, Thai, White Indo, and Vietnam.
      At Spectrum Kratom we offer our Kratom in capsules, powders, and liquid extract form. Our capsules simply house finely ground Kratom
      leaves, our powder is finely ground Kratom leaves, and our tincture is ethanol soaked Kratom leaves, with the alcohol removed and 
      reconstituted with distilled water, vegetable glycerin, and a small amount of natural flavoring. Some commonly used verbiage to 
      describe different Kratom types are that Maeng Da & Vietnam are known as green veined strains, Bali is known as a red vein strain, 
      and White Indo & Thai are known as white veined strains.

  <h3>Testing Standards at Spectrum Kratom</h3>
    <p>Although the Kratom industry is currently unregulated, at Spectrum Kratom we believe in “self regulation” and have thus started 
      to adopt some of the same principles and guidelines used throughout the food & herbal supplement landscapes. One of the most 
      important of those standards are the laboratory testing of our Kratom products for a variety of assays including but not limited to:
      yeast, mold, E. Coli, Salmonella, alkaloid content, and adulterants. These reports can easily be viewed by clicking this link,
      and by referencing the Spectrum Kratom product lot number which is printed on the front of your packaged product. We realize most 
      Kratom vendors do not do lab testing, but Spectrum Kratom wants to ensure that it’s customers enjoy “peace of mind” with respect 
      to our pure and un-adulterated products. We believe it’s not enough to just claim that we test our products, but to actually post
      the results on our website for your reference!

  <h3>Spectrum Kratoms Shipping Policy</h3>
    <p>Spectrum Kratom is proud to offer same-day shipping when your order is placed before 3pm PST Monday through Friday. 
      However, if you’re a brand new customer and this is your first order through E Check, we will have to wait until that money clears,
      which may take 2-3 days
      depending on your bank. Once you have established an order with us (at least one order paid for
      previously using E Check) we’ll ship same day as mentioned above. Our free shipping option is
      simply the United States Postal Service’s First Class mail. Because we ship from San Diego CA
      and depending on where you live in relation to this, it could take approximately 5-7 days to
      receive your package with this option. If your order total is over $100, we offer a free 2 day
      shipping option sent via Fedex regardless of where you live within the United States. Paid
      overnight shipping is sent via Fedex, and will be received the next day with the exception of
      Saturday (meaning specifically that if you pay for overnight shipping and your order is placed
      before 3pm PST on a Friday, your order will arrive the following Monday). Please remember
      that your order will only ship the same day when you input the order before 3pm PST
      Monday through Friday, and you’ve already successfully paid with E Check once
      previously.

  <h3>Spectrum Kratoms Refund Policy</h3>
  
    <h4>Refund</h4>
      <p>We’re happy to refund you completely for any product you’ve purchased from us that is unopened and still sealed.
         However, please note that our refund/exchange policy lasts only 30 days from your purchase date, and after we cannot
        offer a refund or exchange. Your refund will be processed and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit
        card or original method of payment within a few days. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted, so
        please be patient or check with your bank for more information as to when you’ll see the
        balance posted into your account.
        </p>
        
    <h4>First Time Customers</h4>
      <p>For first time customers shipping is delayed when using E-Check payment for up to 10 business days. This delay is due
        solely to an increase in fraudulent orders across all Kratom websites that accept E-Check. To ship your order ‘same-day’ 
        please call 1 (760) 492-6402 and we can expedite your shipping by using alternative payment options. Once you have placed 
        a successful order your next order will ship same-day.
